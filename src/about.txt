ABOUT:

Hello there! 

My name is Seth. 

I come from a non-traditional background that's lead me to tech.

From speaking and living overseas in France, playing rocknroll 
for in Nashville, to working for some really interesting startups 
the past few years, I've always pushed myself to exceed my limits
and make and impact for my customers and team around me.

Recently, I've been inspired by the founders and creators laying 
the building blocks of future technology enterprises around us.

In the age of AI and evolving technologies -- it's 
incredibly exciting and empowering. It is perhaps 

While I've been successful in tech sales for many years, my 
passion for development and product has been ignited over the past 
few months as I've completed a crash course in dev.

Which brings me to this site. It's a snapshot of my current 
creative passion and fascination with the evolving world
and my continued belief that we all have more to give and unlock
if we are willing to learn and grow.

We're all just a version 1.0 of many revisions and abstractions.

Cheers,
Seth
